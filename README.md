# Movies-Success-Prediction-and-Recommendation-System-

1.Analysis and extracting the characteristics of movies data.  
2.Design models to predict whether the movie is hit or flop.  
3.Using best performing model for content based suggestion system.  
conclusin:  
--The XGBoost model outperformed the other models used, such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and neural networks, by providing the greatest prediction accuracy.  
--To make these strong predictions more readily available and user-friendly, the XGBoost model was implemented using Streamlit.
